The program constructs a not very proffesionally designed GUI but
it performs all the necessary operation that a calculator needs.

Unfortunatelly it has some minor mistakes:

One is that: the program doesn't perform unless you press the equal button.
You need to press equal to see the result after every operation you made.

The other is that: memory operations don't work perfectly, they produce faulty results 
sometimes but usually they perform very well. Although I searched for the possible reasons
for this fault I couldn't find it.
